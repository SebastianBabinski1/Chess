# Chess

## Hello!

I'm Sebastian and it's my chess game. Project is aimed at improving my skills in JS, TS and React. In early 2000's with friends we played countless hours in HOMM3 "hot seat" mode, so I decided that making this app will be wonderful tribute. App is partly inspired by YT user: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheShadezOfme
Enjoy and check my other projects!

- User can choose difficulty by switching button on landing page. Easy mode shows tips about possible moves when user is holding a piece. 
- Landing page presents buttons, which starts game, shows rules or description.
- Castling, check, checkmate, stalemate, dead position and enPassant is implemented.
- If you forgot rules or movements of pawns - don't worry. You can check it at any moment.

In the future app will allow to play online and score board will be implemented.
